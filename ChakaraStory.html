<h1 style="color:DarkBlue">Water Nation</h1><br><br><br>
<div class = "W">
The Queen fled in exile to the North to the water Nation and hiding within the tundras and various islands in the area, always moving not allowing anyone especially Overlord D, a location to track her to.  She lived in exile for 20 years while in exile the Queen gave birth to MainC.  She trains them rigorously every day, putting their lives and abilities to the test constantly.  The Queen trains them better than any bodyguard, warrior, or soldier she ever been in combat with.  As MainC grew and their chi element manifested.  MainC manifested lightning but also discovered at the end of their training, they have manifested the light of creation.  Which was unseen before to have two chi element and light was extremely rare and the only element that can defeat the shadow element. MainC has gained the ability to enhance their weapon with light energy, but also create an aura of light that acts like protective armor.<br><br>
One day while Queen L was visiting a village, the village was suddenly attacked by Overlord D’s evil forces.  The Queen was not able to just stand by and watch innocent villagers get slaughtered.  So, she began defeating the marauders, but while doing so revealed who she truly was, during the battle the marauders called for reinforcements.<br><br>
Since it was revealed that it was Queen L Overlord D sent his top lieutenant and his top personal servant King W.  During the battle Queen L tells King W, who is acting as a communicate for Overlord D that, “the light chi is coming and will restore Chakara and put and end to you Overlord D.”<br><br>
Just as she finishes her sentence King W erupts in anger and an explosion of darkness and shadows erupts where King W and Queen L were standing leaving nothing but dark black clouds everywhere.  Suddenly the clouds come together in one form, the form slowly solidifies, and it is King W standing alone.<br><br>
Overlord D speaks through King W “now to find the light better start searching this area.  If she is here at this village then the light chi must not be far, or I would have seen or heard of it already.  Time to go North guess it’s only a little ahead of plan.”<br><br>
King W disappears into shadows.  The marauders that the Queen had knocked out or wounded at the same time in sync mock the villagers saying “Our master is coming. Darkness and shadow will sweep this land all not worthy will not survive.”  Then they also retreat into shadows.<br><br>
As night begins to come in MainC becomes more concerned of where Queen L is, they head out to the village she told them she was heading for supplies.  As they get close to the village, they notice that the villagers are preparing for an attack.  MainC approaches a small wooden fence that they can tell was just created.  They approach the entrance and a group of poorly armed villagers surround MainC, all with their weapons aimed at MainC.<br><br>
MainC stands tall and tells the villagers “I came looking for a woman dressed similar to me, but we have the same silver hair color.”<br><br>
An old man steps forward, “That woman since you to look so similar she must have been your mother I take it.  She died defending us and this village from marauders.  It was an amazing battle but when reinforcements came, she couldn’t stand a chance.”<br><br>
MainC yells “I don’t believe you I know what she can do, no one is able to match her skill, never mind defeat her.”<br><br>
The Old Man answers, “If you are her child, you must be the heir to the kingdom, correct?”<br><br>
MainC in a stern voice, “So you know who we are?  Then you know who she was.  Then you should know there is no one who could match her skill!”<br><br>
The Old Man puts his head down and softly tell MainC,” Sorry I didn’t explain who the reinforcements were, it was King W or at least looked like him, hi chi was so dak full of pain and fear.  None of his attacks seemed like his, but somehow, he matched her skills blow for blow.  If anyone was close to her skill it was him, but he seemed so much more powerful.  The way he defeated her was not something he or anyone has done before.  Wouldn’t believe it was possible if I didn’t see it with my own eye.”  He explains the ending to the battle to MainC.<br><br>
MainC asks the villagers where Queen L’s body is. The villagers show them a fresh grave, it is Queen L, they had already buried her out of respect.  They also created a small monument like statue honoring her.  MainC happy as well as honored for what the villagers did for their mother they began to cry.<br><br>
MainC stops crying and says, “I must stay here, help you all defend this village.  My mother died defending you all, and I can’t just leave and let you face death.  It feels as if I did I would be dishonoring her, I will fight along with you and lead only if you ask.<br><br>
Old Man shouts with excitement, “We may have a chance but are you sure?  We don’t have much military experience, as you can see not much weaponry either.  But we got here.”<br><br>
MainC “It may not be much but that’s something I can work with. You can’t teach heart.  Let’s go to battle and give them all we got.”  MainC in excitement shoots a giant lightning bolt into the sky, lighting the entire sky.<br><br>
When the sky is light up, off in the distance villagers can see ……. Of Overlord D’s forces charging toward the village.  One of the villagers raises the alarm, everyone quickly rushes to defensive positions.  MainC heads to the front, they look around at all the villagers, they look scared and nervous with no one trying to lead or inspire.<br><br>
MainC stands forward and turns to the villagers, “We don’t have much time.  I know you don’t know me.  I know your scared.  Overlord D’s forces are getting closer the villagers can feel and hear the footsteps of the force. “But I see you still standing there ready to meet the enemy.  My mother Queen L gave her life defending this village and I can see why.  I am honored to fight with you, and I will give my all like my mother, to honor you, to honor her.  Now stand as proud members of the Water Nation, don’t forget when you come together as one you have the force of a tsunami.”  The villagers raise their heads, some begin to cheer. “Let’s make them pay for what they did to your men, women, and children, your Queen.  Let’s give them our all to the death!”  MainC and all the villagers charge towards Overlord D’s forces.<br><br>
While running towards the evil forces, MainC imbues their weapon with lightning chi.  They then summon lightning to attack the evil forces defeating ¼ of the enemy just before the two forces collide.<br><br><br>
<h2>Water kingdom battle</h2><br><br><br>
With various attacks MainC starts defeating most of the enemy force single handily.  As victory seemed close at hand, the bodies of the slain enemies slowly moved together into a giant pile, the pile suddenly started giving off blavk smoke. The smoke engulfs the pile then it starts changing form, into a crocodile/turtle like creature.  The creature attacks MainC, <br><br>
after another hard battle MainC defeats the creature, doing so revealing their true identity as the heir to the rest of the world.<br><br>
The villagers excited and happy to be alive celebrate their victory with a extravanant part.  At the celebration the Old Man orders a couple of young men to spread the news, “that the light has arrived to bring a new day.”  The young men run off into different directions to inform the other nations.<br><br>
In the meantime word has reached Overlord D that his Z-Golem has been defeated by the light chi user and herir to the lightning kingdom.  Overlord D orders his top lieutenants, bounty hunter, and assassins to hunt down and defeat the heir to the kingdom.<br><br><br>
</div>

<h1 style="color:DarkOliveGreen">Earth Kingdom</h1><br><br><br>

<div class = "E">
	As the celebration comes to an end the Old Man walks up to MainC and asks, “What will you do next? Since you defeated Overlord D’s forces, almost single handedly, he will send a force out of revenge.  Will you head back out to the tundras and continue to live in exile like before? Or will you stay and help defend the village?<br><br>
MainC responds, “you say that like there are only two options. No, I’m not going to do either.  I’m going out to meet the enemy, I will avenge my mother, my people, my kingdom.  I cannot do it alone, any man or woman willing to fight this evil is welcomed to come with me.”<br><br>
At that moment…… men and women pledge their allegiance to MainC and swore to follow them into battle or anything else.<br><br>
MainC then looks at the Old Man and says “What you should do in the meantime is spread word of what happened here, unite the Water kingdom, raise a force in the name of the Water Nation and wait for when I send word.  Dawn has risen, it will be a new day for Chakana.”<br><br>
The Old Man starts crying tears of joy “I will spread the word and try to raise this force.  If you are going out to face Overlord D in battle, as your mother once did, you will need a great force.  You must also have the other nations especially Earth, since no one has better defenses than them.  They are skilled warriors as well and have been in constant battle with Overlord D’s forces for years.  The constant and surprising attacks and tactics made them paranoid as well.  Their captain is EC.  EC lives on the …….. island hidden amongst its’ trees. With their help you should be able to unite the Earth Kingdom and raise another army to battle Overlord D but also be able to give sound military advice.”<br><br>
MainC agrees tot the plan and sets off with a force of….. men and women headed straight to … island in search for EC.<br><br>
As they enter…… island MainC stands with a look of amazement.  MainC has lived in the tundras of the Water Kingdom in exile all their life. They have never seen so much green, so much grass and trees before, they have read about it all but never have seen it.  It was a majestical first sight.<br><br>
Quickly the group realized they had no idea where EC could possibly be, they needed help.  MainC suggest they search for the closest town or village they can find and ask around. It did not take them long to find a village, but as they approach, they notice nobody is around, the whole village appears abandoned.  They search vigorously for any sign of life but find none.  Fearing they were all killed MainC orders everyone to be on high alert and search for a map that shows the Earth Kingdom in better detail.<br><br> 
After a few hours has gone by, they tell MainC that “We could not find any kind of map, but they also couldn’t find a single person dead or alive.”<br><br>
Fearing it is a trap MainC quickly orders the group to “withdraw from the town immediately and set up defensive positions.”<br><br>
Just as MainC finishes a loud and strong rumble can be felt and heard throughout the town.  Suddenly in the middle of the town a giant sinkhole opens up then…… of Earth Kingdom townspeople all armed come charging out the hole.  MainC’s group stood in defensive positions with their weapons ready and pointed at the Earth Kingdom townspeople.<br><br>
MainC carefully steps in front of the group and lay down their weapon, then slowly turns to the group and orders them to do the same.  Looking at each other in concern the group slowly lays down their weapons.<br><br>
MainC turns and looks at the Earth Kingdom’s townspeople and says “We are not here for a fight.  We are searching for EC I was told I can find them here.  I am MainC heir to the lightning kingdom and heir to the throne of Chakana.”<br><br>
A young man steps out in front of the Earth Kingdom’s townspeople.  He looks at all the townspeople and orders them “Stand down everyone I’ll handle this.  Just go back to your usual duties.  If they were truly with Overlord D. they would never have laydown their weapons so easily.”  The villagers slowly lowered their weapons, but instead of going to the town like MainC and the others thought they would, but they went back into the sinkhole.<br><br>
MainC questions the young man, “I have to ask who you are, why do they listen to you like that at such a young age.  And where are they going?  Is the town not in the other direction?”<br><br>
The young man smirks then answers “Yes that is a town but since the war we moved underground.  Sounds weird but after the las war, we created towns, settlements throughout our kingdom underground.  When there are raids or attacks, we have the element of surprise and first attack.  We have tunnels with transportation connecting each settlement and town.  Now my name is ECJ my older brother is EC.  I’ll take you to him but only you, MainC.”<br><br>
MainC says firmly “I will not leave my people.  Especially after I have taken them away from their land, No.”<br><br>
A young woman tells MainC “Go, don’t worry about us we swore to follow you to whatever end.  Sometimes that might mean we wait in foreign land.” Then laughs “We will be fine, besides if it means the end of Overlord D. we will do it.”<br><br>
The entire group at the same time shouts “Yes, Go your majesty.”<br><br>
ECJ tells MainC “Alright follow me” then jumps into the sinkhole. MainC follows.<br><br><br>
Insidethe sinkhole MainC notices a network of tunnels with transportation for each tunnel.<br><br>
ECJ tells MainC “We have to take this one my brother is at ……. Fort.  The Earth Kingdom’s furthest fort to the East, away from the current battles.  It’s a punishment.  My brother screwed up so now him and his men have to pay for it.  I’ll explain better later.”<br><br>
The two enter the transport that starts moving incredibly fast along the track.  MainC was absolutely excited and having fun.<br><br>
ECJ begins to open up about his family to MainC “My brother has raised me since I was 2.  Our father died during the Royal Palace Massacre, he died helping the Queen escape.  At the Massacre our father lord of the Earth Kingdom and the lady of the Fire Kingdom were there and fought to evacuate the Queen.  I’m not exactly sure of what happed to her but since then the Fire Kingdom has isolated themselves.  My brother was only 13 back then but he has been taking care of me since.  During that time he proved to be a great warrior time and time again.”<br><br>
MainC interjects “I mean he sounds like a great man, why is he being punished?  What did he do?”<br><br>
EcJ frowns when hearing that, then laughs “The idiot fell in love.”<br><br>
MainC confused “What? I’m confused is the a monk, priest or something.”<br><br>
ECJ laughs harder then calmly explains “Well he saved a man years ago, he helped the man to heal.  During that time they fell in love, tht’s not the problem infact everyone was happy mybroter formed someone to be with.  But my brother didn’t know who the man really was or what they planned to do.  The man was OC son of Overlord D., my brother didn’t know, how he found out is when OC betrayed him an dinvaded our western lands with his father’s forces.  So as punishment was sent East.”<br><br>
MainC with a stern face says “You would think all those years of loyal service would mean something Especially since EC was not the only one fooled from what I get from the story.”<br><br>
ECJ interjects “It did they were going to kill him, me and his men.  Instead they were sent East and I have to fend for myself until they lift the punishment.”<br><br>
MainC asks “Who is they?”<br><br>
ECJ answers “So they, are the High Council, they have been around since the beginning of Earth Kingdom.  Normally they are fair but since the last war they take traitors, insubordination and sedition extremely sensitively.”<br><br>
While the two are talking,the transport starts vibrating more and more as it moves.  As the vibrating increases a rumble begins to get louder and louder.  ECJ stops talking and the transport to listen to see where the rumbling and vibrating is coming from.  Once they stop it stops, once they start it all starts all over again.  They both look at each other as to assure that it is the transport.<br><br>  
Then suddenly an explosion erupts in the tunnel just missing the transport.  The two hear a deep voice coming from the explosion.<br><br>
“Aagh, Just missed.  All well now that I can see you that’s not happening again?” states Minataro.  The smoke clears and they can see a giant Minatoro.<br><br>
Minatoro charged straight toward MainC and ECJ, MainC pushes ECJ out of the way and MInatoro rams MainC throwing them into the tunnel wall.<br><br>
MainC smiles and tells ECJ “Please stand back, I’m going to enjoy this”  then rises to their feet and tells Minatoro “seriously, my mother would hit me harder than that.”<br><br><br>
<h2>Battle with Minatoro </h2><br><br><br>
“Wow that was incredible” ECJ speaks in excitement.  “You truly are the heir.  We must hurry while you were fighting, I looked to see where Minatoro came from.  Looks like Overlord D has infiltrated our tunnels, we must hurry and report this to my brother.”<br><br>
They get back onto the transport and force it to move at top speed to reach the end of the tunnel.  As they approach the end they notice figures waiting, it is EC and their group.<br><br>
EC demands “What did you two do in that tunnel?  Why did it sound like armies battling?  Someone better say something.”<br><br>
ECJ explains “We were attacked by a giant minataur.  If it weren’s for MainC I would not have made it.”<br><br>
EC looks at MainC and says “Thank you for that.  But who are you and what are you doing here?”<br><br>
ECJ interrupts “That is the heir to the lightning kingdom and of Chakara, their name is MainC.  They have a force of ……… brother waiting on …. Island. Brother they need your help to fight Overlord D.”<br><br>
EC replies “I wish but I must stand my post here.  I do not have the ability to choose my orders anymore.  Besides they won’t allow me to return to the front.”<br><br>
MainC interjects “His reach is not only going stop on the west.  He already has the lightning kingdom and the Outlands, the west has already nearly fallen.”<br><br>
EC interrupts “Sorry but there is nothing you can say to change my mind.  I follow my orders.”<br><br>
ECJ pleads “But brother this is not what father would want.”<br><br>
EC replies “He would not want me to disobey direct orders.”<br><br>
ECJ start to be “But brother.”<br><br>
EC interrupts “That is enough sorry you came all this way to waste your time.  But you can resupply then leave my kingdom."<br><br>
As EC is speaking a rumbling is heard and felt.  MainC and ECJ look at each other.<br><br>
Quickly ECJ goes to warn EC “Brother I almost forgot Overlord D infiltrated the tunnels!”<br><br>
“Is this the same as you experienced?” EC asks.<br><br>
MainC answers “No, this feels much worst.”<br><br>
EC tells them “Overlord D. must be trying to reestablish his southern realm.  If he succeeds, he will be able to squeeze us from both sides.<br><br>
Suddenly a sinkhole appears ECJ the person closest to the hole gets grabbed by the legs and pulled into the hole, then just as fast, the upper half of their body is thrown out………. Of minotaurs come rushing out the sinkhole.  An enraged EC gives the order to his men to charge, just as he says it MainC comes charging towards the minotaurs.<br><br><br>
<h2>The battle for Earth Kingdom</h2><br><br><br>
As the battle ends MainC searches for E.  MainC finds EC crying over the body of ECJ.  MainC suggest to EC “Why not come and avenge his death and not just mourn it.”<br><br>
EC rises then speaks “We will join you but before we do I must send a message to the high council and the rest of the Earth Kingdom.  We will tell them exactly what happened here, how my brother died for the Earth Kingdom.  I will raise the Earth kingdom forces that aren’t in the west under your banner.  We will go together to meet the enemy, with you like my brother wanted.”<br><br>
MainC smiles then says “Great I have some people on ….. island I need to get back too.  Can you show me which way to go there and back quickly?”<br><br>
EC responds, “I could show the right tunnel.  Or I could have your people brought here instead.”<br><br>
MainC laughs, “Yeah that would be better, especially since were heading to the Fire Kingdom next.”<br><br>
EC asks MainC “Why are we going to the Fire Kingdom thought we were riding into war with Overlord D.?”<br><br>
MainC responds “We have the numbers, we have the heart, now we need more fire power.  That the Fire Kingdom has an abundance of.”<br><br>
EC agrees “Okay your majesty, to the Fire Kingdom” and shows MainC the way to the tunnel made for trade with the Fire Kingdom.  “With this tunnel we will arrive at the Fire Kingdom’s main base Mount…….. after you Sire” and the group twice the size as it was before follows MainC through the tunnel.
</div>

<br><br><br><h1 style="color:Crimson">Fire Kingdom</h1><br><br><br>
<div class = "F">
As they move down the tunnel EC looks to MainC and says, “So there is something I forgot to mention about this plan.”<br><br>
“What is that?” MainC inquires.<br><br>
“Well, we haven’t used this tunnel for a few years now.  Ever since the events at the Palace, the Fire Kingdom has stopped trade and communication with the other Kingdoms.  We always expected them to attack the Earth Kingdom, but they never did for some reason.  Word did reach us that they have been strengthening defenses and preparing for a war, but never attacks.” Explains EC.<br><br>
“Great, so they probably sealed the tunnel and were going to be trapped down here.  Why are you only now telling me this?” says MainC depressingly.<br><br>
“Don’t worry it takes a certain skill to create or seal these tunnels.  Chi is imbued in the tunnel support framework.  Besides even if they did, I know how to create an exit.”  ECC explains with a smile on his face.<br><br>
As they reach the end of the tunnel, they notice that it has been maintained in good condition.  Suspicious of traps, MainC orders the group to stay back while they investigate.<br><br>
EC still follows MainC telling them “I am not leaving your side; I made a vow.”<br><br>
The two go and investigate, everything appears normal, so they order everyone to move up.  But they don’t hear any movement, confused they raise their weapons and head back for the others.  They approach where they left everyone, but the ….. men and women have vanished, leaving no tracks or signs to where they went.<br><br>
Bewildered EC asks MainC ”Where is everyone? What could possibly happen to them?”<br><br>
Suddenly a dark black cloud of smoke filled the tunnel in a matter of seconds the two pass out.<br><br>
The two reawaken after some time in a prison cell, with no weapons or equipment, just the clothing they were wearing.  Across from them were many cells that were larger than theirs but stacked upon each other, inside was the group.<br><br>
EC tells MainC ”Well did not see that coming.”<br><br>
MainC annoyed “Can you just focus for a moment we need to get out of here.”<br><br>
EC calmly tells MainC “Don’t worry it’ll workout.  Been in worst situations and come out on top. Pats MainC on the back “Just Relax.”<br><br>
MainC yells at EC “That’s what I’m talking about!  Look where we are how this going be okay.”<br><br>
They hear footsteps of guards coming.<br><br>
MainC ”Great gets better and better.”<br><br>
EC calmly “Relax, we are royalty.  Well at least I was raised to be so.  All we have to do is be polite, speak only when asked or spoken too and bow.”<br><br>
MainC” I bow to no man” in defiance.<br><br>
EC tells MainC “That’s fine.  It’s lady of the Fire Kingdom, who is the ruler here.  And you might want to bow if you want the rest of the group to live.  She is very old fashion.”<br><br>
MainC reluctantly “If it will spare their lives.”<br><br>
EC smiles “I knew I liked you for a reason.”<br><br>
They both begin to laugh.  The guards show up tell them, “You two, our lady wants a word with you.”<br><br>
EC warns MainC as they exit the cell “Remember what I said.”
The guard immediately hits EC and tells him “Be quiet, you will speak only when we allow.”<br><br>
MainC angry balls up their fist while starring at the guard.<br><br>
The guard with his weapon ready asks MainC “What, got something you want to say.”  MainC just puts their head down, the guard mockingly “Yeah, that’s what I thought.”<br><br>
They continue through the dungeon into a lift which brings them to a heavily guarded room in a box room above the room.  Suddenly they see a bright flame appear in the room, then move out of the room.  It appeared to be falling until it changed direction, it was the lady of the Fire Kingdom, using her fire chi to fly.  She lands in front of the two with a frown on her face, while they stand in amazement.<br><br>
FQ demandingly” What are you people doing here.”<br><br>
MainC politely “My name is MainC, I am the heir to the.”<br><br>
FQ angry interrupts “Enough.  I know exactly who you are.  I can tell by your face who you are, you look like your father.  Now tell me what you are doing here.”<br><br>
MainC astonied “You knew my father?  How? When?”<br><br>
FQ ignoring MainC calls for a guard, then tells the guard. “If he ignores my question 1 more time get one of the cells filled with their cute little friends, then drop them in lava.”<br><br>
EC interrupts “Excuse me my Lady, but we are here too.”<br><br>
FQ stops EC from finishing and says “If it weren’t for you, he and his friends would already be dead.  They need to get themselves out of this, I think you already done enough.”<br><br>
MainC humbly “Sorry my lady for whatever I have done to offend you.  We are here for aid against Overlord D.”<br><br>
FQ calmly “That’s better.  But no there is no war here yet.  And I will never trust your people again. Your mother, as powerful as she was, was just as arrogant, I never trusted your father and I told her too, but she was so proud, so in love.  She can change him. Can’t easily change power hungry people.”<br><br>
MainC is noticeably offended but politely responds “My mother was a great woman, I thought you was as well until you offended someone who can’t defend themselves.  My father, I don’t care about your feelings towards him, whatever he is now killed my mother.”<br><br>
FQ angrily interrupts “I know all about what happened, your mother was my biggest rival and best friend.  I know more about your father than you.  Did you know he was best friends with Overlord D. they grew up and served together in the Wind Kingdom.  It was just before Wind Kingdom for some reason dismantled their military.  It was said they discovered something, some say they just gave up trying to compete military wise with the other Kingdoms.  They never had the strongest military, so they would get raided and attacked frequently.  Shortly after their military being dismantled many within their military left seeking work as warriors for other kingdoms.  Two of their most decorated and noticeable were Overlord D and your father, it was until your father met your mother while fighting for the lightning kingdom under her with Overlord D at his side.  Your mother and father fell in love, she convinced him to stay in the lightning kingdom.  He tried to convince Overlord D to stay but Overlord D’s jealousy of your mother’s power and hatred thinking she took your father away he refused and went to the Outlands.”<br><br>
MainC thinking she is finished says mockingly “And I know the rest, yeah I know.”<br><br>
FW angry “Do You.  Do you now.  Did you know I was there at the palace.  Did you know I was there telling your mother to watch your father.  Did you know your father was always jealous of her power and position.  Did you know I had to watch the love of my life give his life because your father was weak and wanted more power.  I loved ECS, he died making sure your mother escaped, I lost an eye making sure that happened.”<br><br>
MainC taken back gulps because they don’t know what to say.<br><br>
FQ calms down and says “No, I will not help, trust or believe you or any of your people.  You must prove yourself, earn the Fire Kingdom allegiance the way your mother did.  You must make our champion submit.  You do that, then we can talk as allies.”<br><br>
MainC with confidence “I humbly accept my lady.”<br><br>
FQ smiles “There may be hope for you.  Well in conversations with royalty at least, but this match yeah you for no hope.  But I like your confidence.  I call the champion of the Fire Kingdom the undefeated, relentless Princess ……….” Then the hall doors open, and a woman covered in flames enters it the princess.<br><br><br>
<h2>One-on-one battle with fire princess</h2><br><br><br>
As MainC and princess battle comes to an end, and just before MainC could make princess submit, alarm goes off.  A bruised and bloody soldier rushes into the arena to report to FQ.<br><br>
The wounded soldiers yell “We’re under attack the inferno gators are coming from the Black Sands.”<br><br>
FQ rises and yells “The time has come Overlord D made his move.  Battle positions everyone.”<br><br>
MainC bows before the queen then says, “Let me fight with you, my lady.”<br><br>
FQ warns MainC “Are you sure these are inferno gators.  He used them during the last war they eat what they kill, then multiply.  They are merciless and relentless, they are the reason we train, we have such a strong military.  It takes a lot to kill them.  You sure your up for this.”<br><br>
As the queen finishes talking ……. Soldiers enter the arena, one helps princess to her feet.  Princess yells out, “Ready for battle my Lady.”<br><br>
MainC with confidence, “I am my Lady. Besides princess could use the back up.”<br><br>
FQ smiles, “Okay, don’t get killed, think there’s a conversation we need to have.”<br><br>
MainC smiles then turns to princess and says, “After you.’<br><br>
Princess gives the order “Charge”, and they all charge out the arena into battle.<br><br><br>
<h2>Battle for Fire Kingdom</h2><br><br><br>
MainC and EC return with princess and the Fire Kingdom soldiers into the arena covered in purple blood.<br><br>
FQ smiles “I’m impressed considered your covered in purple not red means you held your own.  Consider me impressed, I watched you two battle reminds me of your parents.  So in sync with each other, and you two been together for such a short time, I’m impressed.”<br><br>
EC asks the queen “Excuse me but how you know we haven’t been together long.”<br><br>
FQ smiles, “I know about most of the important things in Chakara.  Like the northern invasion failure, or how the tunnels have been compromised.  As I first said I know who you two are, but I needed to see who you really are.  Princess has the ability to see what is in someone’s heart through combat.  Although you showed it on how you decided not to finish her but instead later help her in battle.  I needed to see if you’re better than your parents, and from what I see you are.  That is the way of things, my daughter will one day surpass me as well.<br><br>
“Go to you people they are waiting for you at the hanger.  We will join you against Overlord D.  I will send …….. men and women with you, the rest of our force will prepare to march onto the Outlands when you give the word.”<br><br>
MainC and EC celebrate for a brief second, then stand straight.<br><br>
FQ continues “But first you must head to the Wind Kingdom.  There is knowledge there that will aid us in defeating Overlord D.  In the hidden city of ….. there is knowledge the Wind nomads have that we might be able to use, on the origins of chi and the powers of light and dark.  They studied chi as part of their religion, no one knows more about the light and dark chi then them.”<br><br>
MainC agrees “If we are to truly succeed, we need all the people of Chakara.  Thank you, my Lady.”<br><br>
FQ smiles “Thank you, Sire.”<br><br>
MainC and FQ start to laugh, then princess politely points to an exit, then MainC and EC follow her out the exit to the hanger.  There all of the group and the Fire Kingdom soldiers the queen promised were standing waiting.  They were next to giant hot air balloons.<br><br>
Princess explains, “Well the tunnels are no longer an option, but they wouldn’t help.” She laughs” ……. Isn’t really hidden, it’s just in the sky, you have to fly to get there.  We had these balloons for a long time, from when we were at war with the Wind Kingdom, back when they had a military.  Now they are just being stored, don’t get much use but they can make the journey, they are properly maintained.<br><br>
MainC nervous jumps in one then says “Not too bad.  We been through worst.”<br><br>
Everyone laughs.<br><br>
MainC yells out” Alright who’s ready for a ride, let’s go people next stop the Wind Kingdom.”
</div>

<br><br><br><h1 style="color:Gold">Wind Kingdom</h1><br><br><br>

<div class = "WI">
After a day of flying MainC and the group notice to the west they see a group of tornados.  The tornados are circling each other tearing up the land beneath them.  Everyone starts looking fearful that the zeppelin like balloons, they are traveling in will get pulled toward them, they begin to panic.  Meanwhile MainC notices that the balloons are steady following their course, not changing direction at all.<br><br>
MainC tells the group “Don’t worry everyone our course is staying true.  Look to the north.”  Just as MainC says that in the distance they see what looks like floating mountains.<br><br>
Everyone in amazement gasps and stares, they notice not all are actually mountains.  Some look like grand cities, others look like towns, small villages.  Amon them is one larger than the others, it looks like a grand city, made out of gold, it was the hidden city of ………<br><br>
After how MainC and the group have been welcomed in the past.  MainC orders everyone” Alright everyone be on your guard.   But no hostile or rude actions.  I would like this to smoothly.”<br><br>
EC interrupts “Not sure I would say it is anything, anyone here done to provoke anything.  But as you say your majesty, we will do nothing until you say.”<br><br>
Everyone out loud “We will do as you say.” They all cautiously prepare their weapons.<br><br>
As they reach the city gates, the large golden gates open up.  When the gates open they see ….. Wind Kingdom people, using their chi to fly, just as effortlessly as walking.  MainC and the group were all amazed but confused.  There are so few Wind Kingdom people in the world it was believed they were going extinct while becoming nomads.<br><br>
They enter the city and land the balloon on an open grass field.  Just as MainC and the others disembark an old fragile man and two tall women with spears come following directly behind him, approach.<br><br>
The Old Man introduces himself, “Hi my name is WC I have been sent to welcome you MainC and your people.  We have been expecting you for a very long time MainC.”<br><br>
MainC confused, “Thank you for the welcome.  But how do you know me?  And what do you mean been expecting me for a long time?” <br><br>
EC smiles “Relax the elders will explain everything, just follow me.”<br><br>
EC asks, “All of us?”<br><br>
WC responds “of course, you are all our honored guests.”<br><br>
Relieved the group lower their weapons then follow WC.  They headed toward a giant building that stood taller than the rest, with a golden roof.  As they enter the building, they walk through a grand hall with 80 seats with 5 with a table, floating high in the hall.  Once everyone enters WC closes the doors then rings a bell, suddenly the ceiling opens……. Men and women come flying in each filling the seats of the hall.  As all but the 5 at the table get filled a bright light comes through the ceiling and the last 5 people come in, they sit at the table, clearly, they are the most important people in the room.<br><br>
WC steps forward and introduces MainC and the group, he then turns to MaiNC and says, “Allow me to introduce the 5 grand gurus of the Wind Kingdom, the 5 elders.”<br><br>
The elder sitting in the middle, the largest of the five, begins to speak, “Welcome MainC, we have been waiting for you, I always imagine your mother would be here with you did finally get here.  Sorry for her lost, she will be greatly missed was a great woman, great warrior, and a great queen.  May her chi be eternal.”<br><br>
All the people of the Wind Kingdom at the same time say, “May her chi be eternal.”<br><br>
The elder continues, “Sorry about your father as well.  His fate is one that no one has ever have or should ever share again.”<br><br>
MainC angrily, “What betrayal?  He betrayed my mother and his people releasing Overlord D., betraying my mother again killing her.  Sorry no sympathy for the betrayer.”<br><br>
The elder slams their hand on the table creating a powerful gust of wind that pushes everyone back. “You know nothing about our champion and prince.  And I will not let you slander my son’s name.”  MainC stares in astonishment.  “Yes, I am your grandfather.”<br><br>
MainC was astonished and bewildered, “Grandfather?  My father is a prince?  He was a prince and the champion?”<br><br>
Grandfather explains,” Okay, quick version our government was similar to the other nations where we had a hierarchy, I was the king and naturally he was the prince.  After we changed our government and gave more power to the council turning it into what you see here.”<br><br>
Grandfather firmly, “Your father was one of the greatest warriors we ever had.  Only one person came close to his skill and power, it was Overlord D, his best friend.  The two were unstoppable, but since there are so few warriors amongst our people, the military we had was severely weaker than the other kingdoms.  To increase our strength, as king I was advised to search for ways to accomplish that.  So, I made two simple orders that changed the world.” <br><br>
Grandfather continues, “As a prince his marriage could help with other nation relations, I arranged the marriage of your mother and father.  That was before I sent our two greatest warriors to investigate some ruins in the Outlands, to retrieve a tablet.  The tablet was the tablet of Gaia, it holds the secrets of chi.  We hoped it would have knowledge to increase our chi.  In fact, it explained chi, who was the first chis users, and what happened to them.  After retrieving the tablet and studying it closely, the two discovered the original chis, light and dark.  Realizing the devastating power your father declared the learning and use of light and dark chi taboo.<br><br>
Jealous of your father rank as champion, the love of the wind kingdom people and the arrange marriage to your mother.  Overlord D. fully immersed himself inro gaining the power of dark chi, corrupting his wind chi to darkness.  Using the power to corrupt Overlord D. changed and corrupted the chi of his followers.<br><br>
MainC listening carefully, “I didn’t know about all of that.”<br><br>
Grandfather continues “Oh there is more.  You mentioned your father betraying your mother.  First and foremost, your father loved your mother it was an arrange marriage but those two did fall in deeply in love together.”  He would never betray her, he foolishly released his friend son….” EC looks and listen carefully.<br><br>
The boy wanted to say goodbye to his father, your father let his guard down Overlord D took this chance and used all his strength and corrupt power into a ebony dagger he created with his chi.  He stabbed your father corrupting his chi.  Until then that would be impossible since your father learned light chi to counter him, but when you were conceived the light chi went from him to you.”<br><br>
MainC taken aback, “Wow that’s how I got the light?  Why don’t people know this about him?”<br><br>
Grandfather explains, “Since he and Overlord D were so close, no one believed he didn’t release him.  And your father kept his light chi secret no would believe his strength.”<br><br>
Another elder “Yes, it was absolutely terrible.  And a left stain on the Wind kingdom, such a shame.”<br><br>
All the elders stare at that one Elder speaks again “Sorry about her, you guess who.”<br><br>
The other elder “I have no nephew.  Not anymore.”<br><br>
Elder”I’m sorry I spoke out of term.”<br><br>
The other elder “I apologize as well to you MainC.”<br><br>
MainC smiles “No need to apologize, No harm No foul.”<br><br>
Grandfather speaks “So you said your looking for something to use against Overlord D., to extinguish the darkness.  Right?”<br><br>
BL tells Grandfather “Yes, we must destroy the darkness before it corrupts and destroys us all.”<br><br>
Grandfather responds “Are you sure about that.”<br><br>
MainC confused “Yes, they already killed my mother invaded the western lands of the earth nation and try to resurrect the inferno- crocodiles.”<br><br>
An elder “No, are you sure you want extinguish darkness?”<br><br>
MainC “Yes, why not?”<br><br>
Grandfather “The balance.  That is why there are light and darkness chi. There is no light without darkness and no darkness without light, there must be balance.  The darkness is not extinguishing anyone’s chi, but it is corrupting it, changing it.  The power of light can purify not destroy, if you use it to destroy the light will change to darkness and the light will have to return within another.  It is all about balance.”<br><br>
MainC “I think I understand but how do we stop him?”<br><br>
Grandfather “The plan your mother had was to imprison Overlord D.  She understood the balance.  It is also depicted in the tablet to maintain darkness so that it will be able to live and survive but not thrive and gain power.”<br><br>
Suddenly a female guard comes rushing into the hall, “Noble elders the enemy is here, harpies are coming they are on the horizon and will be here soon.”<br><br>
The elders look at EC then say, “My friend you know what to do.”  All of a sudden EC stands upright takes a deep breath then all his muscles enlarge, he suddenly grows an additional two feet looking about seven feet tall.<br><br>
WC responds, “They will not live past this day.” then bows.  As he stands back up, he looks to MainC and says do you people like to help?”<br><br>
MainC confused says “We would love to, but we can’t fly.”<br><br>
WC laughs “We have multiple ways, my favorite two is take the wind from beneath their wings or use stronger winds to push them down.  I’ll let you choose.”<br><br>
MainC laughs” Well okay, to battle then.” Everyone in the group arm themselves then stand behind EC who walks up behind MainC waiting for the next command.  <br><br>
MainC then yells “Charge” everyone rushes out the hall towards the golden gate, right when they get to the gate the harpies reach the gate as well.

<br><br><br><h2>Wind Kingdom battle</h2><br><br><br>

Just as it looks like they defeated the last of the harpies, another larger wave can be seen heading to the city from a distance.<br><br>
An exhausted MainC looks at everyone, no one had fallen during the battle, but many are wounded, and all even EC are exhausted.  MainC stands before them and says “I’m impressed my friends we fought well, no, you fought well.  I’m sorry we might not make it past today.  But this is not failure, what we did today is historic and I’m proud to spend my last moments with you all.  Let’s make them earn victory.  Charge.”<br><br>
Just as MainC begins to walk WC fly in front of MainC and says, “Your just like your father, a great leader for action but also fight just like your mother, incredible combination.  But I think you should live a bit longer, you have got things to do.  Watch your grandfather.”<br><br>
Suddenly above everyone the five elders are flying towards MainC and WC.  They land in front of them, the elders’ frown “They dare.”  Each elder raises one hand, then the group of tornados in the west disappear then suddenly reappear in the middle of the second wave destroying them all.<br><br>
The elders turn and bow to MainC and the group and they say, “thank you for helping.”<br><br>
MainC says, “You are telling me you watched us fight while you could done that the whole time?”<br><br>
Grandfather speaks “Well it takes a while to do it so someone must stop them before we can do it.  Besides WC was the one who asked you.  Hey, it all worked out you are all stronger for it.”<br><br>
MainC angry “Can’t believe you.  Could have told us the plan.”<br><br>
WC speaks, “Relax friend.  You proved yourself to me and all the warriors in our nation.  You gained followers from this battle, your ranks will increase after this.”<br><br>
One of the elders speaks “He is right we can’t give you anything to use against Overlord D besides knowledge.  But that is because there is nothing to give.  You have the light that is all you need.  We will give you warriors to help in final battles to come.  Your next step on your journey is a dangerous one, there will be no chance of negotiating or talking.  You must take your mother’s throne.”<br><br>
The elder continues “You must go to the lightning kingdom and reclaim your throne.  ……. Son of Overlord D rules the lightning kingdom in his father’s name.  You must go there and stop him and save your mother’s people.  Doing so will unite the kingdoms under one banner in friendship and honor, yours.  It also gives you the strategic position to head straight for Overlord D’s Outland fortress.”<br><br>
MainC tells the elder “That is the plan but will take time for us to get there.”<br><br>
Grandfather responds, “You don’t have time all of the west is now his son ……… took the western lands before you arrived at the Fire Kingdom.  His reward was the lightning kingdom since then he has been attacking the Water Kingdom.”<br><br>
EC gets noticeably upset, while all the Water Kingdom people start getting hysterical.<br><br>
Grandfather continues, “Wait, word is there is a counterattack in the works with the Water and Earth Kingdoms together.  Just not sure when.”<br><br>
MainC steps up, “We need to leave immediately it will take a while for this journey.”<br><br>
Grandfather tells MainC, “No you won’t.  When your father married your mother, he wanted a fast way to go back and forth from here and the lightning kingdom.  When that massacre happened at the palace reached me, I used it to get there but you and your mother were gone, and the enemy was everywhere.  It was a battle for me to get out, when all get their good chance, you will too.”<br><br>
MainC says, “Sure it still works?”<br><br>
Grandfather explains “You need Wind chi to create the vortex and it is made of a chi enhance metal, it can’t be destroyed.  Let me know when you’re ready.”<br><br>
MainC looks at the group and asks, “Are you all ready?”<br><br>
EC steps up and speaks “I think I speak for everyone when Isay let’s do this.”<br><br>
MainC laughs then tells grandfather, “We’re ready.”<br><br>
Grandfather raises the vortex gate then activates it and says, “Goodluck, remember what I said, balance.”<br><br>
MainC and the group walk through the vortex.
</div>

<br><br><br><h1 style="color:SteelBlue">Lightning Kingdom</h1><br><br><br>

<div class = "L">
Suddenly inside the lightning kingdom, the Lightning Kingdom’s castle begins to shake.  A section of the wall within the great hall suddenly crumbled and a doorway appeared from the rubble.<br><br>
While all this is happening all of Overlord D’’s forces converge on the doorway.  In the middle is Overlord’s son and by his side is King W., they form a defensive perimeter around the doorway.<br><br>
First MainC comes through by themselves Overlord D’s son begins to laugh, then all his forces except King W laugh too.  MainC smirks then charges forward, just as MainC starts to move EC comes charging out the doorway followed by the rest of the group.<br><br><br>
<h2>Lightning Kingdom battle</h2><br><br><br>
As the battle nears an end Overlord D’s son and King W both begin to attack MainC at the same time.  EC notices this and out of grief and anger jumps in defending MainC.<br><br>
EC tells MainC” Overlord D’s son is my problem, your father is yours.”<br><br><br>
EC battles one-on-one with Overlord’s son MainC battles King W<br><br><br>
After both intense and emotional battles both EC and MainC walk away victorious.  Although EC walked away, he did not walk away whole, he lost his right hand in battle.<br><br>
MainC notices EC’s hand asks “Are you okay my friend?  Can you continue?”<br><br>
EC responds, “I actually feel fine, no pain.  In fact, I feel great, like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  Feels like my hand is still there.”<br><br>
As EC examines where his hand was, stone from the ground start to change shape forming a hand then gently lands on his wound.  EC starts moving each finger of stone as if they were his actual fingers.  “Ah, this feels natural.”<br><br>
MainC impressed, “Looks good on you, my friend.”  They both laugh MainC continues, “Let’s rally the others this was a tough battle, not sure how everyone else turned out.”<br><br>
As MainC and EC return to where the rest of the group is located, they talk time to check on as many people they can.  Unlike the battles they faced before, this was a hard-fought victory.<br><br>
A wounded female warrior approaches MainC and reports “Your majesty we are victorious, but we lost many.  There are …… casualties and …… wounded.”<br><br>
MainC responds, “Thank you my friend go get some aid.”  The female warriors salute MainC then leave.  MainC yells “I need a small group of volunteers to raise our flag.”  Many men and women volunteer, even wounded, MainC picks three young men.<br><br>
They raise the flag claiming the castle, and a few hours later the sound of many footsteps can be heard throughout the castle.  As MainC and the group start to rise, the footsteps get louder and louder.  MainC orders, “Everyone to the walls, prepare for battle.”<br><br>
MainC and the group reach the castle walls but as they reach the walls, they look out.  It appears like an army but looking harder, MainC notices in front are battle-worn soldiers, followed by ……. People, men women, and children.<br><br>
One of the soldiers steps forward and the soldier’s helmet appears different from the others.  He kneels then removes his helmet the moment he does all the soldiers do the same, at the same time.  He said “You raised the banner of our queen.  We have been waiting for some time for you, your majesty.”<br><br>
As he finishes all the people behind the soldiers kneel.  “My name is ……. steward of the lightning kingdom and your mother’s old teacher.  I know it is truly your majesty, I can see King W your father in you and Queen L.  We are the last of the lightning kingdom, we have been revolting since Overlord D taken control.  We know you and the group need to rest but the moment you’re ready.  All of us able body men and women will follow you into battle against Overlord D.  To avenge your mother our queen, our mothers, fathers, brothers and sister.”<br><br>
MainC smiles with pride “Thank you, thank you all that final battle is just about here, we are going to need al the people of Chakara, especially my people of the lightning kingdom.”  Everyone cheers, MainC continues “When we are rested, we will meet the other kingdoms once we cross the river south into the northern mountains of the Outlands.  From there we will head south to meet Overlord D.  So, prepare, we march soon.”<br><br>
All of the group celebrate and cheer.<br><br>
After a long day of rest, MainC gives the order for the group to pack up camp and begin to march south.  As they reach the lightning kingdom’s southern coast, they see Water Kingdom ships lined in a formation that makes a bridge for MainC and the group to use to cross into the Outerlands.<br><br>
The Old Man from the Water Kingdom village comes walking across the bridge.  He tells MainC “When we received word from the lady of the Fire Kingdom you were in the lightning kingdom.  We thought you might need a way across the river.  Your majesty” then bows.<br><br>
MainC smiles, “I take from this everyone is prepared.”<br><br>
The old man answers, “Water and Earth kingdom forces have all been encamped on the other side of the bridge.  The Fire Kingdom has been giving information but also said their troops are on the way and will meet with us while in battle.  The Wind Kingdom will as well.”<br><br>
MainC responds, “Great, then we move forward” everyone marches across the bridge.<br><br>
Once across, the mighty forces of Water, Earth and Lightning gather together, then march as one single army under MainC’s royal banner.  As they march south MainC becomes increasingly caustious as they don’t encounter any enemies.<br><br>
As they approach Overlord D’s fortress, they see a large force of ……… men and women enhanced with darkness chi in formation prepared to battle MainC and the group.  Once they notice MainC and the group, the enemy charges at MainC and the group.<br><br>
MainC yells out, “Prepare for battle, the enemy is coming” the group go into battle positions.<br><br>
MainC continues, “This is it.  This is the moment we have all been preparing our lives for.  Here now we have the chance to avenge our people.  Our chance to look this evil in the eye and say no more.  Today we will have victory, we already have won.  Look around the land of Chakara is united fighting as one.”<br><br>
Overlord D’s forces are close enough for the group can her the yells from the enemy.<br><br>
MainC continues on, “Now let’s give them our all, for our people, for our land, and for the queen.” Then MainC charges.<br><br>
The group yells out at the same time “For the Queen” and charge.

<br><br><br><h2>Final battle for Chakara</h2><br><br><br>

As the battle rages and it appears MainC and the group are going to win.  Suddenly the battlefield begins to shake, suddenly a sinkhole appears and …….. minotaurs and inferno-diles come rushing out.  When it seems that MainC and the group and retreating, out of the sky coming straight down, Overlord D summoned his harpies force.<br><br>
MainC and the group fight as hard as they can but are overwhelmed by Overlord D’s forces numbers.  As MainC gets outnumbered on the battlefield EC rushes to their side, but a large minotaur also charges at MainC but is closer.  Just before the minotaur strikes Princess falls from the sky landing on and killing the large minotaur.<br><br>
Princess looks at MainC” You have all the fun don’t you.”<br><br>
MainC looks up and from the east Fire and Wind kingdom forces come swooping down from the sky.  With the fresh and powerful reinforcements MainC and the group begin defeating all of the forces.<br><br>
As the battle comes to an end MainC gives orders to the group, “to take prisoners we will not slay all the enemy, then we will be no better than them.”<br><br>
They take the last of Overlord D’s forces as captives, and the group begins to celebrate.<br><br>
MainC interrupts, “Sorry everyone but we’re not done just yet.  Well, I’m not done.  There is still one more person we need to imprison.  But this one I’ll do alone.”<br><br>
MainC walks into the fortress alone.  MainC quickly notices the fortress is empty, the only sound that is heard is the sound of something being sharpened on a grinder.  The fortress is dimly lit until MainC reaches a large cleared, room only thing in it is a large throne and a chandelier made of skulls and bones.  In the throne sits Overlord D sharpening a large axe-hammer.<br><br>
Overlord D speaks, “Look at you little one, haven’t you been a good boy” he laughs.  “Thought your mother was annoyingly impressive, but you.  You united all of Chakara, uplifted and trained their people.  And you did it without selling yourself.”<br><br>
MainC angry, “Don’t you dare speak about her like that.”<br><br>
Overlord D smiles then interrupts, “Boo hoo, she was overrated, to bad she ran away and died like a coward before I could test it.”<br><br>
MainC tells Overlord D “I’ll help you with that she’s the one who trained me.”<br><br>
Overlord D mockingly, “Doubtful, second rate isn’t premium, but it might be fun.  Maye not, we’ll see.”<br><br><br>

<h2>Overlord D one-on-one battle begins</h2><br><br><br>

Halfway through the fight, Overlord D stops and says, “Thank you little one maybe you do have her skill.  But thank you, I’ll let you in on a secret as a gift.  After I’m done with you, I’m going to turn all of your group.  They will be useful with all the battle experience you gave them, leading them here.  I can get rid of those ugly creatures now.  Wait, you already did that for me too, my favorite agent” he laughs maliciously, then attacks again continuing the fight.<br><br><br>

<h2>End of the one-on-one</h2><br><br><br>

The battle comes to an end MainC stands over Overlord D proudly, “I’m not going to end you.  No, there already was a plan to imprison you, we’re going to do that but with a few additions.  Your reign is over Overlord D.”<br><br>
MainC, the group and all the people throughout Chakara celebrate the great victory as word spreads.  MainC follows the previous plan of imprisoning Overlord D, but use they use a Wind Kingdom vortex as the doorway to his prison, with his cell made of earth, fire, lightning chi infused metal.  MainC orders EC and FC to personally accompany MainC to imprison Overlord D.  The three together travel to the Fire Kingdom and toss the key to the cell into mount…..<br><br>
After the imprisonment MainC traveled back to the lightning kingdom and was formally crowned ruler.  MainC asked the rulers of each kingdom to open their borders and continue to aid each other.  In happiness of ending the war and gratitude for MainC actions the rulers agreed to a peace treaty.<br><br>
</div>
Chakara recovered and flourished under MainC’s rule.  During MainC’s rule a coalition of each kingdom’s military united and formed a force to protect the people of Chakara.<br><br>

The coalition name is ……………<br><br>


The myths of Chakara<br><br><br>
